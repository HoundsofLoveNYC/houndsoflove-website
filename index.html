        <h3>About me</h3>
        <!--BIO TEXT-->
        <p>Hi! My name is Mend&#233; and I’ve been a full-time petsitter and dog walker since 2015, caring for hundreds of different animals through other companies and now am working on my own! I value the opportunity petsitting gives me: to care for and share my love with animals and help the people who love them that need someone to count on.</p>

        <p>
          I've been petsitting full time for 4 years and recently transitioned to working on my own after being "on the apps" in combination with my regular clients! I started petsitting on the side to bring joy into my life and to help out owners and their animals in my spare time, and it just took over my life! 
        </p>

        <p>
          I operate solo and have experience with dogs and cats (and birds!) of all energy types, age, and need. I have worked with elderly dogs with mobility issues, dog with separation anxiety, administered medication (pills and injections), and have done wound care for animals fresh out of surgery. I regularly pick animals up from daycare when their caregivers will be home late and often take my regulars to vet appointments for an hourly rate. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Working on my own, rather than for a large company with a cast of rotating walkers, I treasure the chance to build trusting, reliable relationships with my animals and their families! I only work with one client at a time. I do not do pack walks unless the clients have asked, specifically, to walk with a neighbor in the same building. 
        </p>

        <p>
          My flexible schedule allows me to accommodate most last-minute requests, as well as affords me the opportunity to volunteer my labor in my free time with a local harm reduction organization. 
        </p>

        <p>I also donate $50 from my profits each month to an organization that works with criminalized survivors. I offer a one time 5% discount if you, too, contribute to their work. Ask me for more information! 
        </p>
        
        <p>I'd love to schedule a meet and greet soon and talk about how I can meet your needs. If you’re interested in working together, please send me a <a href="sms://+15402723383">text</a> or <a href="mailto:mende.lescalleet@gmail.com">email</a>!</p>

          We have worked with Mende as a sitter for our 8-year-old cat, Fritz, for over a year now, and we highly recommend her!  She has always been incredibly flexible and reliable.  She is friendly, respectful, confident in her abilities with animals, and we trust her in our home.  Whenever we book with her, she always sounds genuinely excited to see our cat, which is such a pleasure!  Since the beginning, I have been impressed with how she remembers things about Fritz's needs and his personality.  She sends wonderful updates while we are away, with videos of Fritz purring and playing with her--we can see how happy he is when she cares for him!

          Mende is truly wonderful. She is so easy to work with in terms of scheduling and payment. I love the daily photos and reports on their walks. You can tell she truly loves spending time with each of the furry friends and she really cares about the dog's happiness.

          I have nothing but positive things to say about Hounds of Love. Not only is Mende such a sweet and kind person, she absolutely LOVES animals. She is beyond communicative, reliable and has been able to accommodate me and my dog on such  short notice. I promise your animal will be in good hands with Mende, can't recommend her enough!!

          Mendé is awesome! She is very friendly and responsible. She always keeps me updated about my dogs walks and sends me picture or video updates. She is also very easy to get in touch with. I trust her very much. I highly recommend her for all your pets walking or pet sitting needs!

          Mende's great!  We've used her since we moved to NYC a year or so ago and she's responsive, punctual, communicative, and generally just lovely.  We more than trust with her our home, large dog and 3 cats, and are lucky we found her :)

          Highly recommend. Mende looked in on my cat while I was out of town. She's reliable and made the whole process hassle-free. Reasonable rates, plus she sends updates after each visit. Also, my cat liked her.
